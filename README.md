Biosample Spectral Repository.

# Installation, Build, & Run instructions

### Conda:

For additional cmds see the [Conda cheat-sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf).

 * Download and install either [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#installing) or [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html).
 * Create new environment (env) and install ``conda create -n <environment_name>``
 * Activate/switch to new env ``conda activate <environment_name>``
 * ``cd`` into repo dir.
 * Install ``python`` and ``pip`` ``conda install python=3.11 pip``
 * Install all required dependencies (assuming local dev work) ``pip install -r requirements/dev.txt``.

### Build:

  #### with Docker:
  * Follow the [run instructions below](#using-docker) using docker-compose.


  #### with Python ecosystem:
  * ``cd`` into repo dir.
  * ``conda activate <environment_name>``
  * Build and install package in <environment_name> conda env: ``pip install .``
  * Do the same but in dev/editable mode (changes to repo will be reflected in env installation upon python kernel restart)
    _NOTE: This is the preferred installation method for dev work._
    ``pip install -e .``.
    _NOTE: If you didn't install dependencies from ``requirements/dev.txt``, you can install
    a looser constrained set of deps using: ``pip install -e .[dev]``._

### Run:

  #### using Docker (for production):
  * Download & install Docker - see [Docker install docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
  * ``cd`` into repo dir.
  * Setup env vars:
    * ``export DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=admin``
    * ``source scripts/prd/gen_secret_key.sh``
  * Copy both the SSL certificate and the private key to ``nginx/cert.crt`` & ``nginx/cert.key`` respectively. For local
    testing of the prd service see [creating self-signed SSL certificates](#self-signed-ssl-certificates) for
    instructions on how to create "fake" ones.
  * Build and run with ``docker compose up``, add ``-d`` to run in the background.
  * The site can then be accessed using any browser from ``https://localhost``

  #### with Python ecosystem (for development):
  * Follow the above [Build with Python ecosystem instructions](#with-python-ecosystem).
  * For a completely fresh start and rebuild of the database: ``./scripts/dev/rebuild_db.sh``.
  * Run ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=biospecdb.settings.dev python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000``
  * The site can then be accessed using any browser from ``http://localhost:8000``

  ### Self signed SSL certificates:
    Warning! This is intended of local testing only and not for use in production.
  * Install ``openssl``
  * ``cd nginx``
  * ``openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -x509 -out cert.crt -keyout cert.key -days 365``
    Note: This certificate is valid for 365 days. Also, when accessing https://localhost your browser will flag the site
    as unsafe and the certificate as invalid. 

### Custom Deployment Settings:

  * ``EXPLORER_CHARTS_ENABLED``: Include the spectral data files, if present in query results, for download as zip file.
  * ``EXPLORER_DATA_EXPORTERS_ALLOW_DATA_FILE_ALIAS``: Exhaustively scan query result values for relevant filepaths to
    collect data files. Does nothing when ``EXPLORER_DATA_EXPORTERS_INCLUDE_DATA_FILES is False``.
  * ``AUTO_ANNOTATE``: Automatically run "default" annotators when new spectral data is added. [Quality Control Annotations](#quality-control-annotations).
  * ``RUN_DEFAULT_ANNOTATORS_WHEN_SAVED``: Run newly added/updated annotator on all spectral data if annotator.default 
    is True. WARNING: This may be time-consuming if the annotators takes a while to run and there are a lot of spectral
    data samples in the database. See [Quality Control Annotations](#quality-control-annotations).


# DB Management
We're currently using sqlite requiring the following setup instructions:

For a quickstart run the provided script [rebuild_db.sh](scripts/dev/rebuild_db.sh), otherwise follow the instructions
below. The default superuser credentials are username: admin, password: admin. Set the env var
``DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`` to override the default given in [rebuild_db.sh](scripts/dev/rebuild_db.sh).

* cd into repo
* ``python manage.py migrate``
* ``python manage.py migrate --database=bsr``
* ``python manage.py createsuperuser``
* ``python manage.py loaddata centers queries``
* ``python manage.py loaddata --database=bsr centers observables instruments qcannotators biosampletypes spectrameasurementtypes``
* ``python manage.py update_sql_views``
* ``python manage.py runserver``

For running the Quality Control Annotators (QCAnnotators) use the following:

* ``python manage.py run_qc_annotators``

...using the following option ``--no_reruns`` to NOT run annotators on existing annotations, but instead leave their
existing computed values as they are. This will, however, still run all "default" annotators on all ``SepectralData``
entries that have not yet been annotated.

On subsequent deployments only ``python manage.py runserver`` is  needed, unless the db (db.sqlite) is nuked from
disk.

When the models are changed only the following migration commands are required:
* ``python manage.py makemigrations user``
* ``python manage.py makemigrations uploader``
* ``python manage.py makemigrations catalog``
* ``git add biospecdb/apps/uploader/migrations``
* ``git add biospecdb/apps/user/migrations``
* ``git commit -asm"Update model migrations"``
* ``python manage.py migrate``
* ``python manage.py migrate --database=bsr``


The DB can be dumped to a file using the following:

`` python manage.py dumpdata --indent 4 uploader --exclude uploader.uploadedfile --output test_data.json``

### Custom commands:

 * ``python manage.py prune_files [--dry_run]``: Delete any and all orphaned data files.
   * ``--dry_run``: Output files to be deleted but don't actually delete anything.
 * ``python manage.py update_sql_views``: Create/update all custom SQL views in uploader.models.
 * ``python manage.py run_qc_annotators [--no_reruns]``: Run all Quality Control annotators on the SpectralData database table.
   * ``--no_reruns``: Don't run annotators on existing annotations, leave computed values as is.


# Usage

    WIP.

# Quality Control Annotations

Entries in the ``SpectralData`` table can be annotated by running ``QCAnnotators`` on them, thus producing a value
stored as an ``ACAnnotation`` associated with the ``SpectralData`` entry. The ``SpectralData`` table contains the actual
spectral data file containing the wavelength and intensity values. It may be desirable to annotate this data with
certain quality control metrics that can later be used to filter the data. Such quality control functions are to be
implemented as a subclass of ``Biospecdb.app.uploader.qc.qcfilter.QcFilter``.
They can then be added to the database belonging to the ``QCAnnotator``
table. Annotations of this annotators can then either be manually associated with a ``SpectralData`` entry manually via
the admin form, or by "default" if the ``QCAnnotator.default = True``. They can also be run by using the
``run_qc_annotator`` Django management command. The behavior for running these annotators and
population of the ``QCAnnotation`` table is configurable and is described below.

#### Settings:

The following QC annotator settings are available in ``biospecdb.settings.base``:

 * ``AUTO_ANNOTATE``: If ``True`` and if default annotators exist in the DB, they will be automatically run upon
                      adding/updating ``SpectralData`` entries. _(Default: True)_
 * ``RUN_DEFAULT_ANNOTATORS_WHEN_SAVED``: If ``True`` and ``SpectralData`` entries exist in the DB, newly added/updated
                                          default annotators will be run on all ``SpectralData`` entries.
                                          _(Default: False)_

#### Management Command:

Running ``python manage.py run_qc_annotors`` will run all existing default annotators and re-run existing annotations on
all relevant ``SpectralData`` table entries. The option ``--no_reruns`` can be used to prevent re-running existing
annotations and only run default annotators that have not yet been run.
NOTE: If ``AUTO_ANNOTATE = RUN_DEFAULT_ANNOTATORS_WHEN_SAVED = False`` using the ``run_qc_annotors`` management command
is the only mechanism for creating quality control annotations.

# Testing
_NOTE: The following steps require ``pip install -r requirements/dev.txt``._

### Linting:
Facilitates in testing typos, syntax, style, and other simple code analysis tests.
  * ``cd`` into repo dir.
  * Switch/activate correct environment: ``conda activate <environment_name>``
  * Run ``ruff .``
  * This can be automatically run (recommended for devs) every time you ``git push`` by installing the provided
    ``pre-push`` git hook available in ``./githooks``.
    Instructions are in that file - just ``cp ./githooks/pre-push .git/hooks/;chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push``.

Facilitates in testing core package functionality at a modular level.
  * ``cd`` into repo dir.
  * Run all available tests: ``pytest .``
  * Run specific test: ``pytest tests/test_util.py::test_base_dummy``.

### Regression tests:
Facilitates in testing whether core data results differ during development.
  * WIP

### Smoke Tests:
Facilitates in testing at the application and infrastructure level.
  * WIP
